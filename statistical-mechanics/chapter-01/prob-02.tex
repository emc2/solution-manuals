Assuming that the entropy $S$ and the statistical number
$\Omega$ of a physical system are related through an arbitrary
functional form
\[ S = f(\Omega)\]
show that the additive character of $S$ and the multiplicative
character of $\Omega$ \emph{necessarily} require that the function
$f(\Omega)$ be of the form
\[ S = k\ln\Omega \]

\subsection*{Solution}

For a system $A$ consisting of two subsystems $A_1$ and $A_2$, where a
given macrostate of $A$ implies that $A_1$ and $A_2$ are each in a
specific macrostate.  Then the number $\Omega$ of microstates of $A$
corresponding to this macrostate must equal the product of the number
$\Omega_1$ of microstates of $A_1$ and $\Omega_2$ of microstates of
$A_2$ corresponding to each system's macrostate.

Now, the quantity $S$ for a system $A$ is equal to the \emph{sum} of
the $S_i$ for each of the composite systems of $A$.  If $S$ is related
to $\Omega$ by some function $f$ as
\[ S = f(\Omega) \]
Then we have that
\[ S_1 + S_2 = f(\Omega_1) + f(\Omega_2) \]
We also have
\[ S = f(\Omega_1\Omega_2) \]
Putting these together, we get
\[ f(\Omega_1\Omega_2) = f(\Omega_1) + f(\Omega_2) \]
This is satisfied by a logarithm of some arbitrary base $b$
\[ \log_b(\Omega_1\Omega_2) = \log_b(\Omega_1) + \log_b(\Omega_2) \]
thus we have
\[ f(\Omega) = \log_b(\Omega) \]
we can then apply the log change-of-base formula to set this to the
natural log
\[ f(\Omega) = \frac{\ln(\Omega)}{\ln b} \]
We can then set $k = \frac{1}{\ln b}$ to get
\[ f(\Omega) = k\ln(\Omega) \]

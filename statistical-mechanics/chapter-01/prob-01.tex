\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] Show that, for two \emph{large} systems in thermal
    contact, the number $\Omega^{(0)}(E^{(0)},E_{1})$ can
    be expressed as a Gaussian in the variable $E_{1}$.  Determine the
    root-mean-square deviation of $E_1$ from the mean value
    $\bar{E_1}$ in terms of the other quantities pertaining to the
    problem.
  \item[(b)] Make an explicit evaluation of the root-mean-square
    deviation of $E_1$ in the special case when the systems $A_1$ and
    $A_2$ are ideal classic gasses.
\end{itemize}
